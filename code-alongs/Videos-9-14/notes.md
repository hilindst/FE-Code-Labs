Builder Pattern, Design Patterns

Builder VS Constructors?

Facade Pattern: to clean up script (less code and easier to change)
API: Application Programming Interface
axios vs fetch
take a difficult or ugly API and turn it into a nice api function, can put it into a module somewhere else

Observer Pattern: an object(the subject) maintains a list of dependents (observers) and notifies them when state changes, usually by calling a broadcast method
EventTarget.addEventListener() is an example of the observer pattern


Destructuring: for arrays and objects

Spread Operator: ..."variable" assign variable to remaining properties in array or object. HAS TO BE LAST VARIABLE in destructuring syntax.  Will also separate items in an array, including strings, sets, arrays
  In Function Calls-each element passed as separate argument
  In Array Literals-can combine arrays by spreading each array, or create a copy of an array(only 1 level deep, will not copy nested arrays)
  In Object Literals-


can swap variables left hand assigning variables, right hand values
 [name1, name2] = [name2, name1];

 using OR operator || to fallback null object to empty object
 let { firstName, lastName } = getPerson() || {};

 console.log(firstName, lastName);

 Memoization:store previous results caching values based on previous inputs
  useful with Fetch API and Axios

Recurvsive Functions:

Dynamic programming: 

Callbacks:  ????  what is Fetch and API and theres a poke api?

Asynchronous: Callback Hell, Promise, Async Await, Call stack....
  Javascript single-threaded: one-by-one in order

  Callstacks

  What is .then ?  .catch   Promise API
